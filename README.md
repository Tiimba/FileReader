# Overview
This is my first C++ Real Project, simple but using POO and important sintax features.

It is a file manager, it reads, writes and appends data from any file.

# Usage
First you need a host with any C++ Compiler (GCC, for example).

Build it
```
g++ main.cpp -o main
```
Run, follows below how to use

```
Usage:
         ./file mode file-name "Input Data"

Examples:
        APPEND: ./file append tryout.txt "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet."
        WRITE:  ../file write tryout.txt "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet."
        READ:   ./file read tryout.txt
```
